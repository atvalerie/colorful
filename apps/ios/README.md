# iOS shell

**Status:** Initial SwiftUI shell is present and has an Xcode project. The
Rust-backed queue and real audio session are the next implementation slices;
the current build intentionally uses preview tracks until those boundaries are
connected.

Planned stack: Swift, SwiftUI, AVFoundation/AVAudioEngine, Keychain, background
audio mode, MPRemoteCommandCenter, and MPNowPlayingInfoCenter.

The iOS target reuses the shared engine contracts and uses Android and desktop
behavior as references. The first milestone is a real TIDAL playback slice on
the daily-driver iPhone: SwiftUI, Keychain, AVFoundation/AVAudioEngine,
background audio, Now Playing controls, queue restoration, and native device
testing. Android product parity is not a prerequisite.

To build the shell on macOS, see [`../../docs/ios-builds.md`](../../docs/ios-builds.md).
